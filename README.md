# Fake-News-Prediction-ML
# Overview:
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to detect fake news articles. With the rise of misinformation and disinformation online, the ability to automatically identify fake news is crucial for maintaining informed public discourse and combatting the spread of false information. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms, the system aims to distinguish between legitimate news articles and fabricated or misleading content.

# Dataset:
The dataset used for this project consists of labeled news articles, where each article is tagged as either "real" or "fake". The dataset is curated from various sources and is preprocessed to remove noise, handle textual features, and ensure data quality. Additionally, it may include features such as article text, metadata, publishing source, etc.

# Methodology:
Text Preprocessing: Cleaning and tokenizing the text data, removing stopwords, punctuation, and applying techniques like stemming or lemmatization.
Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features from the text data such as word frequency, TF-IDF scores, and n-grams to represent the articles numerically.
Model Selection: Evaluating different machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Neural Networks for classification tasks.
Model Training: Training the selected models on the preprocessed dataset, optimizing hyperparameters using techniques like cross-validation.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of each model using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Model Deployment: Deploying the best-performing model into a production environment, providing an interface for users to input news articles and obtain predictions.
# Implementation:
The project will be implemented using Python programming language and popular libraries such as NLTK, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras for NLP tasks, and model building. Additionally, a web interface will be developed using Flask or FastAPI for easy access to the prediction system.
# Usage:
Data Preparation: Ensure the news articles to be evaluated are in a compatible format for input.
Model Deployment: Access the web interface and input the news article text.
Prediction: Obtain the prediction output indicating the likelihood of the input article being fake or real news.
# Future Enhancements:
Incorporation of additional features such as metadata analysis, social network analysis, or credibility scores for improved prediction accuracy.
Integration of real-time monitoring to detect and flag potentially fake news articles as they emerge.
Collaboration with fact-checking organizations and journalists to validate model predictions and provide feedback for model refinement.
